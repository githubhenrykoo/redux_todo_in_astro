Okay, let's analyze the provided Git activity log.

**1. Summary of Key Changes:**

*   **Chatbot Panel (`src/components/panels/chatbot.jsx`):**
    *   **LLM Provider Switching:** The most significant change is the introduction of the ability to switch between a local and a server-based LLM (Ollama) provider.  A button has been added to allow the user to easily toggle between "Local" and "Server."
    *   **Debounced Switching Logic:**  The LLM provider switching has been debounced to ensure that multiple clicks do not trigger concurrent requests.
    *   **Improved Error Handling and Status Reporting:**  The error handling for Ollama connection attempts has been enhanced, providing more informative messages to the user (including timeout errors). The UI now shows a loading state (`isSwitching`).
    *   **Model Selection:** Default model selection and handling of available models has been updated.
    *   **Removal of Terminal WebSocket Connection Code:** Code related to connecting to a terminal via WebSocket and processing natural language commands to terminal commands has been removed.

*   **Notion Panel (`src/components/panels/notion.jsx`):**
    *   **OAuth Implementation:** The Notion panel has been significantly updated to use OAuth for authentication.  This includes:
        *   A "Connect to Notion" button that opens an OAuth popup.
        *   Handling the OAuth callback and storing access tokens in `localStorage`.
        *   Displaying the workspace name.
        *   A "Logout" button to disconnect from Notion.
    *   **API Endpoint Integration:** The Notion panel now fetches data from a dedicated API endpoint (`/api/notion/getpage`) to interact with the Notion API using the access token.
    *   **Connection State Management:** The panel now tracks and reflects the connection status to Notion (`connected` state).
    *   **Error Handling:** Error handling has been improved, displaying error messages when data fetching fails.
    *   **Data Syncing:** Data Syncing is now linked to both `pageId` and `connected`
*   **API Endpoints (New Files):**
    *   `/src/pages/api/notion/callback.js`:  Handles the Notion OAuth callback, exchanging the authorization code for an access token.
    *   `/src/pages/api/notion/getpage.astro` and `/src/pages/api/notion/getpage/index.js` and `/src/pages/api/notion/getpage.js`:  Fetches data from a specific Notion page using the provided access token. Extracts page content, subheadings, tables and descriptions.
*   `src/pages/auth/notion/callback.astro`: Stores tokens in localStorage and redirects.

**2. Team Collaboration Patterns:**

*   **Clear Division of Labor:**  The log suggests a relatively clear division of labor.  One developer (or a sub-team) focused on the Chatbot Panel and its LLM integration, while another developer/team worked on the Notion integration using OAuth.
*   **API Driven approach:** All API routes are being shifted to the `getpage` route.
*   **Centralized API Interaction:**  A key pattern is the shift towards using dedicated API endpoints (`/api/notion/*`) to handle the interaction with external services (Notion). This is a good practice as it centralizes the authentication logic and data fetching, making the frontend components cleaner.
*   **Event-Driven Communication (Notion):** The use of `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('notionConnected', { detail: authData }))` to notify components of a successful Notion connection indicates a decoupling of the OAuth flow from the UI. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

**3. Project Progress Analysis:**

*   **Significant Progress:** The team has made significant progress in both the Chatbot and Notion panel integrations.  The Chatbot panel now supports switching between different LLM providers, increasing flexibility. The Notion panel has been upgraded to use a more secure and standard authentication method (OAuth).
*   **Focus on User Experience:**  The changes show a focus on improving the user experience.  The LLM provider switching, improved error messages, and the Notion OAuth integration all contribute to a more polished and user-friendly application.
*   **Refactoring/Cleanup (Chatbot):** The removal of the terminal WebSocket code from the Chatbot panel may indicate a decision to postpone or abandon that feature, or it may have been moved to a different part of the application.
*   **Robust OAuth Integration** A complete OAuth cycle appears to be integrated with `Astro.cookies` for tokens.

**4. Recommendations for the Team:**

*   **Code Review:** Given the scope of the changes, thorough code reviews are essential.  Pay close attention to error handling, security (especially token storage and handling), and the overall architecture of the Notion integration.
*   **Testing:**  Implement both unit and integration tests for the new API endpoints and the Notion panel's OAuth flow.  Test different scenarios, including successful authentication, failed authentication, network errors, and invalid page IDs.
*   **Security Audit:**  Consider a security audit of the Notion integration, especially the OAuth flow and token storage.  Ensure that tokens are stored securely and that the application is protected against common OAuth vulnerabilities.
*   **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect the new features and changes.  Document the LLM provider switching in the Chatbot panel and the OAuth integration in the Notion panel.
*   **Consider a Centralized State Management Solution:** As the application grows, consider using a centralized state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or the Context API with useReducer) to manage the application's state more effectively. This can help to avoid prop drilling and make the code more maintainable.
*   **Communicate Regarding Terminal Feature (Chatbot):** The removal of the terminal WebSocket code should be discussed to determine the future of that feature.  If it's postponed, document the reasons and the plan for future implementation.
*   **Review API Endpoints:** There appear to be several API endpoints that may be doing the same thing. Consolidate and review these as needed.
*   **Error Handling:** Add a more robust catch all or error console logging.

By following these recommendations, the team can ensure that the application is secure, maintainable, and provides a positive user experience.
