    *   **Action:** Optimize CID generation by experimenting with different multicodec selections (e.g., choosing between SHA-256 and Blake2b). Analyze the impact on CID size and retrieval performance. **Expected Outcome:**  Demonstrate understanding of the trade-offs involved in multicodec selection and identify optimal configurations for specific use cases.
*   **MCard Integration:**
    *   **Action:** Apply the MCard framework to a simulated real-world use case, such as verifying the authenticity of digital documents. Use a testing framework like Jest to validate the MCard implementation. **Expected Outcome:** Demonstrate a working MCard implementation and measure its performance in a controlled environment.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the relationship between g_time and content verification in more detail, focusing on potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. Explore the use of timestamps and cryptographic signatures for enhanced security. **Expected Outcome:**  Document a clear understanding of g_time's role in MCard and propose improvements to its security model.
*   **Performance Analysis:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct performance testing of IPFS under varying network conditions (e.g., high latency, low bandwidth). **Expected Outcome:** Identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization in IPFS performance.
    *   **Action:** Profile CPU and Memory usage when storing and retrieving large files using IPFS. Implement strategies for optimizing these such as using buffered file operations. **Expected Outcome:** A measurable reduction in IPFS resource usage for large files
