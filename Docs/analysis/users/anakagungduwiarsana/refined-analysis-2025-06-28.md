**3. Technical Expertise Demonstrated:**

*   **React.js (Advanced):** Demonstrates a solid understanding of React through the use of JSX syntax, state management with `useState`, component lifecycle methods (implicitly in `useEffect` hooks), and custom hooks for managing map data. Utilized `useMemo` effectively to avoid unnecessary re-renders after the first code review.
*   **Component-Based Design:** Designs well-structured, reusable components. Code is modular and generally well-commented. The `MapPanel` is a strong example of a self-contained, reusable component.
*   **Event Handling:** Proficient in handling user events (e.g., sidebar clicks) and updating the UI accordingly.
*   **State Management (React Hooks):** Effectively uses `useState` to manage the active tab, sidebar item, and chatbot visibility. A deeper understanding of more complex state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) would be beneficial for scalability (see Recommendation 8).
*   **Asynchronous Operations (Simulated):** Understands how to handle asynchronous data updates, even if currently mocked. Demonstrates knowledge of Promises and asynchronous JavaScript.
*   **Mapping Libraries (Leaflet):** Integrates and uses Leaflet effectively to display interactive maps. Demonstrates understanding of map layers, markers, popups, and event handling.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Uses modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals. Code is clean and readable. Adheres to established coding standards (verified with ESLint - no major violations).
*   **Astro:** Familiar with Astro for project structure and component integration.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Proficient in Tailwind CSS, utilizing its utility classes to create responsive and visually appealing UIs.
*   **Code Quality (Mostly High):** Code is generally clean and follows best practices. However, initial code review flagged a potential XSS vulnerability and some unnecessary re-renders. The issues were promptly addressed. Static analysis tools (ESLint, SonarQube) report minimal issues.

**4. Specific Recommendations:**
