**4. Areas for Improvement and Recommendations**

*   **Refactor NotionMCP (High Priority):** The `NotionMCP` class is a monolithic component. Refactor into smaller, single-responsibility modules.  *Specific Actionable Steps:*
    *   Extract Notion API communication into a dedicated `NotionAPIClient` module. Implement retry logic for API failures.
    *   Create a `MarkdownConverter` module to handle the transformation from Notion blocks to Markdown.  Add unit tests to this module.
    *   Develop a `FileStorageManager` module responsible for file creation and storage. Implement a configurable storage directory.
    *   Establish a robust `ErrorHandler` module to centralize error handling and logging.
*   **Enhance Error Handling (High Priority):** Improve error handling in both `NotionMCP` and `NotionMCPServer`. Provide specific, user-friendly error messages. *Specific Actionable Steps:* Implement custom error classes for different error scenarios (e.g., `NotionAPIError`, `MarkdownConversionError`). Use try-catch blocks with specific error handling for each type of error.
*   **Implement Standardized Logging (Medium Priority):** Utilize a consistent logging library (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) for improved debugging and monitoring. *Specific Actionable Steps:* Integrate Winston with different log levels (debug, info, warn, error). Configure logging to output to both the console and a file.
*   **Implement Dependency Injection (Medium Priority):** Use dependency injection for the Notion client within `NotionMCP` to improve testability and maintainability. *Specific Actionable Steps:* Use a constructor-based dependency injection pattern. Create mock Notion API clients for unit testing.
