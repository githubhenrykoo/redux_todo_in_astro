Sanitize inputs and outputs appropriately using a trusted library. Consult with the security team for a comprehensive security audit. He should learn about common web vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.
*   **Time Tracking Implementation Audit (Medium Priority):**  Thoroughly check the `DefaultLayout.astro` to understand where the time tracking data is sent/stored and ensure compliance with privacy regulations. Document the purpose and functionality of the time tracking feature and its impact on user data.
*   **Service Worker Optimization (Medium Priority):**  Carefully consider which assets to cache in the service workers and how to handle updates to ensure users always have the latest version of the application without breaking offline functionality. Use a service worker build tool to automate the process of generating and managing service worker files. Implement a cache-busting strategy to force updates to cached assets. Monitor service worker performance and identify opportunities for optimization.
*   **PWA Optimization and Testing (High Priority):**  Test the PWA functionality on real devices and across different browsers to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience. Implement performance optimizations, such as lazy loading images and code splitting, to improve PWA performance. Ensure the PWA meets all the requirements for a high-quality PWA, such as providing a manifest file, registering a service worker, and using HTTPS.
