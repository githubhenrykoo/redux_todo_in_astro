Focus areas should be on the maintainability of the `DimensionCard` rendering logic and the robustness of the error handling. Ensure comprehensive unit tests cover all major functionalities and edge cases. Specifically, test how different data structures and API responses affect the rendering of the component.
*   **Service Worker Strategy Refinement:** The `sw-chatbot.js` and `sw.js` files employ different caching strategies. Alessandro should create a comprehensive strategy document to evaluate and justify whether those strategies are optimal for *all* API endpoints and static assets. For the API endpoints, is network-first always the best strategy, especially considering real-time data? Consider using a more robust caching library like Workbox to simplify service worker management and provide advanced caching features.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** While there is error handling in `CLMDisplayPanel.jsx`, ensure error messages are consistently user-friendly and provide specific guidance on how to resolve the issue. Instead of generic error messages, provide links to documentation or suggest actions the user can take to fix the problem.  Use a standardized error logging system to capture error details for debugging.
*   **Google Docs Integration Security Audit:** The Google Docs integration is complex, involving external authentication and data access. Conduct a thorough security audit to verify that proper access control and permissions are in place to protect user documents from unauthorized access or modification. Pay close attention to OAuth scopes and data encryption.
*   **Secure Environment Variable Management:** Alessandro understands the need for environment variables. The next step is to implement a robust secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or a cloud provider's secret management service) to store and access API keys and other sensitive information securely. This will prevent accidental exposure of credentials in the codebase or configuration files. A checklist should be developed for checking that no keys are exposed in any commits.
*   **Refactor Notion Upload Logic:** The logic in `uploadToCardCollection` in the Notion panel should be refactored for improved clarity and maintainability. The current implementation is somewhat convoluted and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable functions. Consider adding unit tests to cover the refactored code.
*   **Enhanced Playwright Test Coverage:** While Playwright tests exist, the assertion coverage needs to be expanded to cover more critical aspects of the application's functionality. Focus on adding assertions that verify the correctness of data displayed, the accuracy of calculations, and the proper handling of error conditions. A code coverage tool should be run on Playwright to get hard numbers.
*   **API Documentation Gap Analysis:** Conduct a gap analysis to identify any APIs currently lacking proper documentation (using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or similar). Prioritize documenting critical APIs that are frequently used by other developers or external services. Consider automating API documentation generation from code comments.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:** Actively consider accessibility when building and modifying components, so the app is usable for people with disabilities. Use tools like WAVE or axe to identify and fix accessibility issues. Ensure proper ARIA attributes are used and that the application is keyboard-navigable.
*   **Investigate CLM Data Model Ownership:**  During the CLMDisplayPanel work, it wasn't clear if Alessandro had a full understanding of the underlying data model. It would be useful to pair him with the data scientist on the team who designed this model, to ensure he's not only displaying the data correctly, but understands how it's generated and used.

**5. Work Style Observations**
