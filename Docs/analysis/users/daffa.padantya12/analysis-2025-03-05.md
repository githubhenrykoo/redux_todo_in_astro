Generated at: 2025-03-05 06:50:59.744443

Okay, let's analyze the provided Git activity log for `daffa.padantya12`.

**Overall Summary of Changes**

The primary focus of these commits is setting up an automated Git log analysis workflow using Gemini (Google's generative AI model) within a GitHub Actions environment.  The developer is iterating on the workflow, addressing issues like API quotas, prompt engineering, code chunking, error handling, and integration of critique and refinement steps.  The goal is to automatically generate insightful reports on team and individual developer activity based on the Git history.

**Key Changes in Detail:**

*   **Initial Setup and Gemini Integration:**
    *   The initial commits introduce the core workflow structure in `.github/workflows/git_analysis.yml`.
    *   They integrate the Gemini API to analyze Git logs and generate summaries, identify patterns, and provide recommendations.
    *   The workflow is triggered on a schedule (cron) and manually via `workflow_dispatch`.  It takes inputs for the number of days to analyze and a custom query.

*   **Git Log Generation:**
    *   The workflow generates both a global Git activity log and individual logs per user.
    *   The logs include diffs between the first and last commits within the specified time period.
    *   Later, the logs include the first and last commit hashes.

*   **Analysis and Refinement Steps:**
    *   The script `analyze_logs.py` is created to call the Gemini API and generate analysis reports.
    *   The generated analyses are saved in the `Docs/analysis/` directory, both for the team as a whole and for individual developers.
    *   A separate script `refine_analysis.py` is added to critique the initial analysis using Gemini and generate a refined version. This involves creating critique prompts and refinement prompts.

*   **Addressing API Quota Issues:**
    *   The developer encounters rate limit issues and implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff using the `generate_with_retry` function.
    *   Code chunking is added, splitting large Git logs into smaller chunks for the Gemini API to process to avoid exceeding token limits.
    *   Delays (`time.sleep`) are added between API calls to reduce the load on the Gemini API.

*   **Prompt Engineering and Modularity:**
    *   The prompts used to guide Gemini's analysis are modularized into separate files in `Docs/config/prompts/`. This improves organization and maintainability. Separate prompts for group analysis, user analysis, summaries, group critique, user critique, and refinement are created.
    *   The prompt templates are designed to guide the AI model to extract specific insights such as key changes, collaboration patterns, individual contributions, work patterns, technical expertise, and actionable recommendations.

*   **Name Mapping:**
    *   A `name_mapping.py` file is created to map GitHub usernames to real names in the generated reports. This enhances readability.

*   **Refinement Improvements:**
    *   The refinement process is improved by using a `refine_with_critique` function, which generates a critique of the initial analysis and uses it to refine the analysis itself.

*   **Error Handling and Robustness:**
    *   Retry mechanisms are introduced with exponential backoff to handle `ResourceExhausted` errors (likely related to rate limiting).
    *   The code gracefully handles cases where log files are missing or empty.

*   **Git Operations:**
    *   A `git pull --rebase origin main` command is added to the workflow to ensure that the GitHub Actions branch is up-to-date before pushing changes.

**In essence, daffa.padantya12 is building an automated system to provide data-driven insights into code development activity using the power of generative AI.** They are actively working to make the system more reliable, robust, and produce higher-quality, more insightful analysis.
