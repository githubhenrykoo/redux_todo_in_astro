Based on the provided Git activity log, here's a summary of the main changes made by daffa.padantya12:

**Core Focus:** Refinement and enhancement of the automated Git log analysis workflow, particularly addressing issues related to API usage, prompt design, and result quality.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Refinement Workflow Implementation:** Introduced a new process to refine the initial analysis generated by the Gemini model. This includes:
    *   Generating a critique of the initial analysis using a defined prompt (`GROUP_CRITIQUE_PROMPT`, `USER_CRITIQUE_PROMPT`).
    *   Using the critique to refine the analysis, addressing feedback, incorporating insights, and enhancing recommendations, using the `REFINEMENT_PROMPT`.
    *   Saving the refined analysis to a new file with a "refined-" prefix.

*   **Prompt Modularity:**  Moved prompts from being hardcoded strings in the Python script to separate, imported Python files (`Docs/config/prompts/*`). This makes the prompts easier to manage, maintain, and experiment with. This includes prompts for:
    *   Group Analysis (`GROUP_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`)
    *   User Analysis (`USER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`)
    *   Summary (`SUMMARY_PROMPT`)
    *   Group Critique (`GROUP_CRITIQUE_PROMPT`)
    *   User Critique (`USER_CRITIQUE_PROMPT`)
    *   Refinement (`REFINEMENT_PROMPT`)

*   **Quota Exceeded Fix (Rate Limiting and Chunking):** Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff (`generate_with_retry`) to handle `ResourceExhausted` errors from the Gemini API, indicating rate limiting. Also, content is chunked and analyzed separately to prevent token limits, incorporating delays between API calls.

*   **Name Mapping:** Added a name mapping feature to replace GitHub usernames with real names in the generated logs and analyses using `NAME_MAPPING`.

*   **Git Log Generation Improvements:** Switched from using `git log --patch` to `git diff` to get the changes between the first and last commits in the specified timeframe, likely for better performance or compatibility.

*   **File and Directory Structure Updates:** Introduced a directory structure for storing logs and analyses, including separate directories for group and user analyses, and refined analyses.
