The developer, daffa.padantya12, made significant changes to a GitHub Actions workflow for analyzing git logs, focusing on incorporating the Gemini AI model for analysis and refinement. Here's a summary of the main changes:

**1. Gemini AI Integration and Analysis:**

*   **Core Analysis:** The workflow now uses the Gemini AI model (specifically `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-1.0-pro` at different iterations) to analyze git logs and provide summaries, identify patterns, and offer recommendations. This analysis is performed on both the overall team's logs and individual user logs.

**2. Analysis Refinement:**

*   **Critique-based Refinement:** Introduced a refinement process where the initial analysis from Gemini is reviewed and critiqued by the same model. The critique is then used to generate a refined analysis, addressing accuracy, depth, and actionability. The refinement logic was improved.

**3. Name Mapping:**

*   **Real Name Implementation:** Implemented a name mapping system to display real names instead of GitHub usernames in the generated logs. This uses a `NAME_MAPPING` dictionary defined in `Docs/config/name_mapping.py`.

**4. Git Log Generation Improvements:**

*   **Differential Log Generation:** The workflow now generates a diff log showing changes between the first and last commits within the specified timeframe.
*   **Per-User Logs:** Logs are now generated for each individual user, stored in separate directories.

**5. Workflow Optimization and Bug Fixes:**

*   **Code Chunking:** Implemented a chunking function (`chunk_content`) to handle large git logs by splitting them into smaller chunks for processing by Gemini, addressing potential token limits. A `prompt_template` was added to the chunking to provide more context.
*   **Rate Limiting Mitigation:** Added a delay (2 seconds) between API calls to avoid rate limiting issues when using the Gemini API.
*   **Rebase Before Push:** Added `git pull --rebase origin main` to the workflow before pushing changes, ensuring the local branch is up-to-date and avoids potential conflicts.
*   **Path Corrections:** Corrected various file paths to ensure the workflow can correctly locate and process log files.
*   **Indentation and Syntax Fixes:** Multiple commits addressed indentation and syntax errors in the YAML and Python code.

**6. New Workflow Files:**

*   **`gemini_test.yml` -> `analyze.yml` -> `git_analysis.yml`:** Creation and modification of a workflow file for automated git log analysis using Gemini. Multiple versions of this file exist showing the iterative process.
*   **`refined.yml`:** A separate workflow file for refining the analysis, triggered manually and uses the Gemini model to critique and refine the analysis. This was combined back into the main workflow file.

**7. Directory Structure:**

*   **`Docs/analysis`:**  A directory to store the generated analysis reports (team and individual).
*   **`Docs/log`:** A directory to store the generated git logs (overall and per-user).
*   **`Docs/log/users`:** Contains subdirectories for each user, storing their individual git logs.

In essence, the changes represent a significant effort to automate git log analysis using AI, focusing on improving accuracy, readability, and providing actionable insights for both individuals and the team.
