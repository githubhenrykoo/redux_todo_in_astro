# Developer Analysis - daffa.padantya12
Generated at: 2025-03-05 06:37:56.415491

The developer, daffa.padantya12, primarily focused on improving the Git log analysis workflow in a GitHub Actions environment. Key changes include:

*   **Quota Exceeded Fix**: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for Gemini API calls to handle rate limits and resource exhaustion errors (`de3aa9e`). This involves the `generate_with_retry` function, increased delays between API requests, and error handling to prevent workflow failures due to API limitations.
*   **Prompt Modularity**: Moved prompts from the main workflow file to separate configuration files (e.g., `GROUP_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`, `USER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`, `SUMMARY_PROMPT`) for better organization and maintainability (`f884a27`).
*   **Content Chunking**: Added a `chunk_content` function to split large Git logs into smaller chunks for processing by the Gemini API (`29e965e`).
*   **Rate Limiting**: Introduced `time.sleep()` calls to add delays between API requests to avoid rate limiting issues with the Gemini API (`d7e8a79`, `29e965e`, `de3aa9e`).
*   **Git Rebase**: Included `git pull --rebase origin main` before pushing changes to resolve potential conflicts (`777402c`).
*   **Name Mapping**: Implemented a name mapping feature that gets real names (`17cb00a`) for usernames in the analysis reports through `Docs/config/name_mapping.py` and get_name.py`.
*   **Refinement Tuning**: Enhanced the analysis refinement process by separating critique and refinement prompts (`64a0158`). A critique is generated first and is then used as a base to refine the original analysis.
*   **Workflow Restructuring**: Combined all functions into one file (`ec320a9`).
