Here's a breakdown of the changes made by daffa.padantya12, focusing on the key functionalities and improvements implemented:

**Overall Goal:** The primary objective is to automate the analysis of git logs using the Gemini AI model and create refined analysis.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Refinement Workflow:**
    *   Introduced a process to refine the initial analysis generated by the Gemini model.
    *   The `refine_analysis.py` script:
        *   Reads the generated analysis files (team and individual).
        *   Generates a critique of the analysis using a prompt tailored to assess accuracy, depth, actionability, and missing patterns.
        *   Uses both the original analysis and the critique to generate a refined analysis.
        *   Writes the refined analysis to a new file.
    *   The workflow now creates two analysis files: the initial analysis and a refined one based on critique.

*   **Prompt Modularity:**
    *   Replaced hardcoded prompts with modular prompts stored in external files.
    *   Introduced `Docs/config/prompts/` directory to store prompts for different stages: group analysis, user analysis, summary, group critique, user critique, refinement.
    *   This makes the analysis prompts more manageable and easier to update without modifying the core Python script.

*   **Handling API Rate Limits/Quotas:**
    *   Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for Gemini API calls (`generate_with_retry` function).
    *   This function retries the API call a certain number of times if a `ResourceExhausted` exception (rate limit hit) is encountered.
    *   Added `time.sleep()` calls between API requests and before generating the summary to avoid exceeding quota limits.

*   **Chunking of Content:**
    *   Implemented a `chunk_content` function to split large git logs into smaller chunks.
    *   The `analyze_content` function iterates through these chunks, analyzing each and then summarizing if there are multiple chunks.
    *   This addresses the issue of Gemini having limitations on input size.

*   **Name Mapping:**
    *   Introduced a `name_mapping` to display real names instead of GitHub usernames in the generated reports.
    *   A `get_name.py` script is used to retrieve the real name from the `NAME_MAPPING` dictionary.

*   **Logging Enhancement:**
    *   The git log generation now uses git diff to show changes between the first and last commit within the specified time frame.

**Workflow Restructuring:**

1.  **Generate Git Logs:** Extracts git logs and user commits.
2.  **Analyze Logs with Gemini:** Uses Gemini to generate analysis reports (team and individual).
3.  **Refine Analysis:** Critiques and refines the analysis reports using Gemini again.
4.  **Commit and Push:** Commits the generated log and analysis files.

**Individual Commit Details:**

*   **`refinedment add`:** (48ae0a3) Adds the refinement analysis functionality, generating a critique and then a refined report.
*   **`quota exceeded fix`:** (de3aa9e) Implements retry logic with exponential backoff to handle API rate limits and adds delays between requests.
*   **`prompt modularity`:** (f884a27) Moves prompt templates to separate files for better organization and maintainability.
*   **`chunk add`:** (29e965e) Adds functionality to split large git logs into chunks for processing by the Gemini API.
*   **`rate limit`:** (d7e8a79) Includes time delays between Gemini API calls to prevent rate limiting.
*   **`git rebase`:** (777402c) Adds git pull with rebase strategy
*   **`chunking function`:** (ab82982) Implements the `chunk_content` function to break down large logs.
*   **`name mapping`:** (17cb00a) Introduces name mapping to use real names in analysis reports.
*   **`refinement tuning`:** (64a0158) Refines the prompts used in the refinement analysis process.
*   **`all function combined`:** (ec320a9) Combines all functionalities into one action.
*   **`path problem`:** (3493d0d) Fixes the paths to log files
*    **`path naming`:** (f282e68) Corrects file path and naming convention
*   And other commits fix the path errors and indentations

**Summary of Main Changes:**

Daffa.padantya12 has significantly enhanced the automated git analysis workflow by:

*   Adding a refinement stage to improve analysis quality.
*   Modularizing prompts for easier customization.
*   Implementing robust rate limit handling to prevent API errors.
*   Breaking down large logs into smaller chunks to accommodate API limitations.
*   Using real names rather than usernames.
