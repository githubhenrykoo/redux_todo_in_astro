The git activity of Daffa Padantya shows a focus on improving and refining a system for analyzing git repositories using AI, specifically the Gemini model. The main changes revolve around:

*   **Prompt Engineering and Modularization:** Significant effort was invested in restructuring and modularizing prompts for different analysis tasks (group analysis, user analysis, critique, refinement). This involves creating separate prompt files for each task.
*   **Refinement Process:**  Implementing a refinement process where initial analyses are critiqued by the AI, and the critiques are then used to generate a refined analysis.  This involves prompts for both critique and subsequent refinement.
*   **Template Refinement:**  Changes focused on refining a template used for generating analysis reports. This includes adding a template for Headers, Executive Summary, Analysis Framework, Management and Supporting documentation.
*   **Chunking for Large Content:** The system includes logic to chunk large Git logs to fit within the AI model's context window, along with logic to summarize the analyses of these chunks. The chunk size was explicitly set to a larger amount to account for the AI's token limit
*   **Rate Limit Handling and Error Handling:**  Implementing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle API rate limits from the Gemini model. Comprehensive error handling were used when retrying the API requests to ensure the functionality of the process.
*   **Configuration:** Added Default values to the template refinement process.
