The developer `daffa.padantya12` has been making several improvements to a git analysis workflow, focusing on refining the analysis and handling potential API limitations:

*   **Refinement Template Update:**  The developer updated the refinement template in the `git_analysis.yml` workflow. This update includes adding default values for various sections of the template, ensuring that all required fields are populated even if the refinement process doesn't explicitly provide them. The code now also refines each section separately and conditionally includes the refined content if it's available, improving modularity.
*   **Prompt Chunking:** Implemented prompt chunking in the git analysis workflow to handle large git logs. This involves breaking down the content into smaller chunks, analyzing each chunk separately, and then summarizing the results. Added the ability to assemble the final template.
*   **Quota Exceeded Fix:** Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting issues when using the Google Gemini API. This also included adding delays between API calls and increased delay before summary requests. The goal is to avoid exceeding API quotas.
*   **Prompt Modularity:** The developer has modularized the prompts used in the git analysis workflow by moving them into separate files (e.g., `group_analysis.py`, `user_analysis.py`, `summary.py`). This makes the prompts easier to manage and reuse. They also created and used critique prompts to refine the git analysis.

In summary, the changes aim to improve the robustness, modularity, and accuracy of the git analysis workflow, with a focus on handling API limitations and refining the analysis process.
