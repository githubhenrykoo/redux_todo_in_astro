The developer's git activity primarily focuses on improving the automated Git analysis workflow using Google's Gemini AI model. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**1. Prompt Chunking and Summary (commits: `fda7fa22`, `de3aa9ee`, `29e965e1`, `d7e8a79cb14`):**

*   **Problem:** The initial implementation likely encountered issues with the size limits of the Gemini API, leading to failures when processing large Git logs.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Introduced `chunk_content()` function to split large input into smaller chunks before sending to the Gemini API.
    *   Implemented a summary prompt to combine the analyses from the chunks into a single, coherent report.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Added `time.sleep()` calls to introduce delays between API requests to avoid rate limits.  Exponential backoff retry logic was implemented to handle `ResourceExhausted` errors from the Gemini API.

**2. Prompt Modularity (commit: `f884a27ec955`):**

*   **Goal:** Improve code organization and readability.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Moved prompts for group analysis, user analysis, and summary generation to separate files (`Docs/config/prompts/`).
    *   This made the main workflow script (`.github/workflows/git_analysis.yml`) more modular and easier to maintain.

**3. Refinement Process (commits: `48ae0a3f`):**

*   **Goal:** Improve the quality of the generated analyses through critique and refinement.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Added a refinement step that involves generating a critique of the initial analysis using the Gemini model.
    *   Used the critique to generate a refined analysis, attempting to address the criticisms and improve the overall quality of the report.
    *   Prompts for critique and refinement were also modularized into separate files.

**4. Meta Template Prompt (commit: `fda7fa22`):**
*   **Goal:** Improve the flexibility and modularity of template generation.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The creation of prompts that follow a specific format.
    *   This allows flexibility in how the components for template creation are handled.
*   **Document Generation:**
    *   Improves the structure of generated documents by ensuring the structure and layout are appropriate.

In essence, the developer iterated on a Git analysis workflow to handle large Git logs, manage API rate limits, and improve the quality of the generated analysis reports by incorporating a critique and refinement step, all while improving code modularity by moving prompts to separate files.
