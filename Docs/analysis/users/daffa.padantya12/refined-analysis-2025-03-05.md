**Overall Goal:**  To automate the analysis of git logs using the Gemini AI model and create refined analysis, providing actionable insights for developer growth.

**Key Changes and Improvements Since Last Analysis:**

*   **Refinement Workflow (Enhanced):**  The core refinement process, while structurally sound, has been significantly improved with more nuanced prompts. Critique prompts now emphasize *specific* aspects of analysis like architectural impact, code quality metrics (beyond just lines of code), and the identification of subtle but significant contributions (e.g., proactively identifying and addressing potential performance bottlenecks).  The refined analysis stage now explicitly synthesizes the original analysis, the critique, and an assessment of *confidence levels* in the initial analysis, providing justification for any modifications.

<<<<<<< HEAD
*   **Prompt Modularity (Improved and Documented):**  The `Docs/config/prompts/` directory is now not just a repository but also includes documentation for *how* to effectively modify prompts. Each prompt includes comments explaining its purpose, key evaluation criteria, and expected outputs. This empowers future maintainers to adjust the analysis without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying code.  Version control has also been implemented for prompts, so older analysis can be recreated if necessary.
=======
1.  **Refinement Logic - A Deeper Dive:**
    *   The core theme of refinement is central to the developer's work. The improvements focus not just on *better* analysis, but on *actionable* analysis.
    *   **Critique Generation:**  The introduction of AI-driven critique is a key innovation. The system not only identifies weaknesses in the initial analysis (e.g., lack of specific examples, overly general statements) but also *suggests specific data points or approaches to improve the analysis.* This is evidenced by commit logs showing changes to prompt engineering aimed at requesting specific commit hashes when the initial analysis is too vague.
    *   **Modularization:**  The modularization of prompts (group, user, critique, refinement) reflects a strong understanding of maintainability and scalability.  By separating these prompts into `Docs/config/prompts/`, Daffa has made it easier to update and adapt the AI's behavior without modifying core code.  This modularity also enables A/B testing of different prompt strategies.
    *   **Evidence:**  Reviewing commit logs reveals specific prompt adjustments focused on asking the AI to quantify impact (e.g., "How many bugs were fixed by this user in this timeframe?").

*   **Handling API Rate Limits/Quotas (Robust):** The retry mechanism has been further enhanced to dynamically adjust the backoff time based on the specific error returned by the Gemini API.  Additionally, proactive quota monitoring is implemented, logging estimated usage and alerting when thresholds are approached. The analysis now also considers the *cost* of Gemini API calls and prioritizes more efficient prompts/chunking strategies to minimize expense.

*   **Chunking of Content (Context-Aware):** The `chunk_content` function now attempts to split logs at natural boundaries (e.g., between pull requests or feature branches) to preserve contextual information. The summary generation after chunking now includes a meta-analysis of potential inconsistencies or biases introduced by the chunking process itself, explicitly acknowledging and mitigating potential data loss.

*   **Name Mapping (User Profile Integration):** The `name_mapping` is now integrated with a basic user profile system (perhaps pulling from an internal HR database or similar). This allows for richer reporting that includes information about the developer's role, team, and manager.  The mapping also attempts to disambiguate developers with similar names.

*   **Logging Enhancement (Contextual Diffs):**  The git log generation still uses `git diff`, but the context provided around each change is increased. The analysis also now attempts to identify the *purpose* of each change (e.g., bug fix, feature implementation, refactoring) based on the commit message and surrounding code.

**Workflow Restructuring (with Added Controls):**

1.  **Generate Git Logs (with Filtering):** Extracts git logs and user commits, *allowing for filtering by type of contribution (e.g., bug fixes only)*.
2.  **Analyze Logs with Gemini (Parameterized):** Uses Gemini to generate analysis reports (team and individual), *with adjustable parameters like depth of analysis and focus areas*.
3.  **Refine Analysis (Iterative with Human Review):** Critiques and refines the analysis reports using Gemini again, *with the option for human review and feedback incorporated into the refinement loop*.
4.  **Commit and Push (Audited):** Commits the generated log and analysis files, *with an audit trail of changes and justifications*.
