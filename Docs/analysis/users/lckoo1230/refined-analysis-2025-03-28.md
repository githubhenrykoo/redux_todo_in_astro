*   **Code Documentation:**  Add JSDoc-style comments to explain complex logic, component interfaces, and API endpoints.  Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or JSDoc.
*   **Security Auditing:** Conduct a thorough security audit of the authentication implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Pay close attention to cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks, particularly in data retrieval and rendering. Use tools like Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse to identify and address performance issues.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Consolidate configuration settings into a single file and use environment variables to manage different deployment environments.  Use a tool like dotenv to manage environment variables in development.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Some files, like `config/index.js`, mix operations. Decompose these into smaller, more focused modules to improve maintainability. Document each module's purpose clearly.
*   **Explicitly handle the hashing function:** In cases where a more secure hashing algorithm is unavailable, inform the user of the reduced security context and explain the rationale for the fallback. Provide clear guidance on the limitations of the less secure algorithm.
*   **Collaboration:** Encourage Henry to proactively share his knowledge and expertise with other team members. He can lead code reviews, mentor junior developers, and present technical topics at team meetings.
*   **Version Control:** Henry should leverage Git branches for each feature being developed. It is also important to keep feature branches up to date with the main branch to prevent potential merge conflicts.
