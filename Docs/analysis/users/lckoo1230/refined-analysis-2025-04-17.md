**4. Specific Recommendations**

These recommendations are tailored to Henry's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on actionable steps that align with both his career growth and the organization's needs.

*   **Code Review and Refactoring (Proactive):** Given the iterative development style, schedule regular code reviews with a senior developer to identify potential areas for refactoring and optimization. Focus on extracting reusable components/functions to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy. **Action:** Schedule a code review session weekly, focusing on code clarity, reusability, and adherence to coding standards.
*   **Unit and Integration Testing (Critical):** Implement unit and integration tests for the `CLMDisplayPanel` component to ensure its functionality and prevent regressions. Prioritize testing critical logic, edge cases, and API interactions. **Action:** Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) and write tests for at least 80% of the component's logic within the next sprint.
*   **Error Boundary Implementation (Important):** Wrap the `CLMDisplayPanel` component with an error boundary to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent the entire application from crashing. This improves the application's stability and resilience. **Action:** Implement an error boundary using `componentDidCatch` or a similar approach within the next iteration.
*   **Performance Optimization (Future):**  Explore memoization techniques (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the `CLMDisplayPanel` component. Profile the component's performance to identify potential bottlenecks. Address API performance if it becomes an issue. **Action:** After addressing testing and error boundary implementation, schedule a dedicated time for performance analysis and optimization of the component.
*   **Documentation Enhancement (Ongoing):** Add more comments to the code, especially for complex logic or algorithms.
