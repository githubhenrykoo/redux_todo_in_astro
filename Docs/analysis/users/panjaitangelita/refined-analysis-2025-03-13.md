Measure API response times and resource utilization. Explore caching mechanisms to reduce API calls. Target Completion: 2025-04-22

**Additional Recommendations (Based on the Commit Itself & Limited Data):**

*   **Encourage More Frequent and Diverse Commits:** This single commit provides very limited insight. Encourage Angelita to commit smaller, more focused changes across a wider range of tasks to provide a more complete picture of her abilities.
*   **Investigate the Initial Naming Convention:** Understand the context behind the initial use of "panjaitangelita." While seemingly superficial, it could indicate team communication issues or a prior misunderstanding. Open a dialogue with the team to clarify naming conventions and ensure consistent identification across projects.
*   **Monitor for Consistency:** Pay close attention to Angelita's work over the next few weeks/months to gauge the consistency of her performance and commitment to documentation. Track the frequency and quality of her contributions to documentation, code, and team knowledge sharing.

**5. Missing Patterns in Work Style (Requires Further Observation):**

*   **Communication & Collaboration:** The Git log offers no insight into Angelita's collaboration skills. *Recommendation:* Gather feedback from team members on her communication, responsiveness, and willingness to help others. Observe her participation in code reviews, team meetings, and collaborative documentation efforts. Questions should address if she solicits feedback on meta-templates.
*   **Time Management & Organization:**  *Recommendation:* Observe if Angelita consistently meets deadlines and manages her time effectively. Track the time it takes her to complete documentation tasks and resolve issues.
