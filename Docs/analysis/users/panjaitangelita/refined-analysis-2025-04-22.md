This may include experience with Markdown, static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo), or documentation-as-code approaches.
*   **API Integration:** Based on the mention of Gemini API, Angelita likely has experience integrating external APIs into Python scripts or other workflows. This involves understanding API documentation, handling authentication, and processing API responses.

**4. Specific Recommendations (Based on the Document Snippet Itself):**

These are *not* recommendations *for* Angelita as a developer, but rather recommendations that are apparently *included in the document* about *a project* Angelita is involved with, and potentially specific to her responsibilities. They highlight areas for improvement related to a project or system Angelita is involved with.

*   **Improve Robustness:** The document suggests the need for more robust error handling in the AI-assisted template system. Specifically, this may require implementing exception handling, input validation, and logging mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent system crashes.
    *   **Actionable Steps:** Implement comprehensive exception handling in the Python script. Add input validation to the Gemini API calls to prevent malformed requests. Introduce detailed logging to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
*   **Enhance Maintainability:** The need to make the documentation framework easier to maintain over time. This could involve refactoring code, improving documentation, and reducing technical debt.
    *   **Actionable Steps:** Refactor the Python script to improve code readability and modularity. Document the code thoroughly, including explanations of key algorithms and data structures. Implement a coding style guide and enforce it using linters and code formatters.
*   **Improve Scalability:** The document highlights concerns about the Gemini API's scalability under heavy load and suggests considering alternative approaches or caching. This could involve optimizing API calls, implementing caching mechanisms, or exploring alternative AI models that are more scalable.
    *   **Actionable Steps:** Evaluate the performance of the Gemini API under heavy load using load testing tools. Implement caching to store frequently accessed data. Explore alternative AI models that are more lightweight or offer better scalability.
*   **Increase Collaboration:** Emphasizes the need to gather feedback from team members on collaboration, communication, and willingness to assist others.
    *   **Actionable Steps:** Conduct a team survey to gather feedback on collaboration, communication, and willingness to assist others.
