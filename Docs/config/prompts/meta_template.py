**Executive Summary**
Okay, I'm ready! To give you a concise executive summary, I need to know what it's about. Please tell me:

*   **What is the subject of the summary?** (e.g., a project, a report, a business plan, a research paper, a meeting)
*   **What are the main objectives or goals?** (What was the purpose of the subject you're summarizing?)
*   **What are the key findings or conclusions?** (What are the most important takeaways?)
*   **What are the recommendations or next steps?** (What should be done based on the findings?)
*   **Who is the intended audience?** (Executives need different information than technical staff, for example.)

Once you give me this information, I can craft a concise and effective executive summary.
