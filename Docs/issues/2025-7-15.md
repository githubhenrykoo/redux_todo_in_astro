Based on my investigation, I've identified the root problems causing the 500 error on the /Page route in your Redux Todo Astro application:

Root Issues
Vite Timeout Issues with Tailwind Processing:
Vite is timing out (after 60000ms/60 seconds) when processing your Tailwind CSS directives in /src/styles/globals.css when imported by /app/src/layouts/SimpleLayout.astro
This specifically happens only on certain routes (like /Page) but not on the homepage
Potential Configuration Problems:
You have both tailwind.config.js and tailwind.config.mjs files, which might be causing conflicts
The PostCSS/Tailwind processing pipeline may be incorrectly configured
Development Mode Limitations:
Running in development mode (npm run dev) with Vite can be resource-intensive, especially when processing Tailwind directives
Your deployment is using unlimited timeout (--timeout 0) as a workaround, but this doesn't fix the underlying problem
Recommended Fixes
Simplify Tailwind Configuration:
Choose one configuration file format (either tailwind.config.js or tailwind.config.mjs) and remove the other
Verify that your Tailwind content paths are correctly set to include all template files
Ensure All Dependencies Are Correctly Installed:
Make sure postcss, autoprefixer, and all Tailwind plugins are installed as dev dependencies
Check for any version conflicts between dependencies
Consider Production Build:
For Kubernetes deployments, consider using a production build (npm run build) rather than running in development mode
Serve the static files with a simple server rather than running Vite in dev mode
Optimize Tailwind Usage:
Consider reducing the number of Tailwind directives or optimizing your CSS
Check for circular imports that might be causing Vite to hang
Fix Callback.astro Syntax Error:
There's a known syntax error in /app/src/pages/auth/notion/callback.astro with template literals that should be fixed
Once you've made these changes to your source code, rebuild your Docker image and redeploy it to Kubernetes. This should resolve the 500 error issues with the /Page route.

Would you like me to help you inspect any specific configuration files more closely before you make these changes?
