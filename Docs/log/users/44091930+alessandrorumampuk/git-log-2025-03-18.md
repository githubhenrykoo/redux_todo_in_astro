 **3. Technical Expertise Demonstrated:**
 
 *   **Python Programming:** Highly proficient in Python. The `llm_evaluator.py` code showcases a robust understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and extensive library usage (e.g., potentially libraries for NLP, JSON handling, and potentially external APIs for safety checks). The code is well-formatted and demonstrates good coding practices.
-*   **Machine Learning/NLP:** Demonstrates significant expertise in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. The `LLMEvaluator` class is strong evidence of this. He understands and implements common evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) and considers crucial aspects like safety, bias, consistency, and instruction following.  He understands the complexities of LLM evaluation.
+*   **Cybersecurity Tools Development:**
+    - Created XSS detection tool for identifying cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
+    - Implemented clickjacking detection mechanism
+    - Developed malicious traffic detection system
+    - Shows strong understanding of web security principles and threat detection
+*   **Frontend Development:**
+    - Successfully implemented Redux for state management
+    - Experience with Progressive Web Apps (PWA) implementation
+    - Demonstrated ability to integrate modern frontend technologies
+*   **AI/ML Infrastructure:**
+    - Installed and began configuration of Ollama for local LLM deployment
+    - Planned integration of Ollama with MCP (Model Control Panel)
+    - Shows initiative in implementing AI infrastructure
