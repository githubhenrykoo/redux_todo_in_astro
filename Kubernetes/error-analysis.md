# Kubernetes vs Docker: Authentication Import Error Analysis

## Debug Findings

After running our deep debugging, we discovered the following critical issues:

1. **Missing Directory**: The `/app/src/lib/authentik/` directory does not exist in the container
2. **Original TopBar Not Replaced**: The original `TopBar.tsx` file (26241 bytes) is still in the container
3. **Import Not Updated**: The DefaultLayout is still importing TopBar from the original location
4. **Environment**: The IS_KUBERNETES environment variable is correctly set to 'true'

This explains why our changes aren't taking effect - they're not properly being included in the container image that's running in Kubernetes.

## The Problem

When deploying our Redux Todo app to Kubernetes, we consistently encounter this error:

```
FailedToLoadModuleSSR
Could not import file.
Could not import ../../lib/authentik/client.
See Docs Reference
This is often caused by a typo in the import path. Please make sure the file exists.
Stack Trace
Error: Failed to load url ../../lib/authentik/client (resolved id: ../../lib/authentik/client) in /app/src/components/panels/TopBar.tsx. Does the file exist?
```

This error does not occur in regular Docker, only in Kubernetes deployment.

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Filesystem and Path Resolution Differences

**Docker**: When running in a standard Docker container, file paths are resolved directly against the container filesystem.

**Kubernetes**: Kubernetes introduces additional layers like volumes, which can affect path resolution.

### 2. Build Process Timing

**Docker**: In a standard Docker build, files are copied in a controlled sequence.

**Kubernetes**: The Kubernetes deployment process might be affecting when files are available during the application startup.

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Behavior

**Docker**: In Docker, the SSR process might have different timing or initialization order.

**Kubernetes**: Kubernetes orchestration might affect the SSR process timing.

### 4. Module Resolution in Dev vs Prod

Our application is running in development mode in Kubernetes, which affects how Vite resolves modules during SSR:

1. In development mode, Vite performs SSR by importing modules directly
2. It tries to resolve all imports before conditional code can execute
3. Even if we have conditional imports, Vite still tries to resolve them during startup

### 5. Container Image Caching

Kubernetes might be using a cached image where our changes haven't been properly applied.

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Created alternative TopBar components (K8sTopBar, SafeTopBar, etc.)
2. ✅ Modified DefaultLayout to use our alternative components
3. ✅ Created a mock authentik client
4. ❌ Used Docker entrypoint scripts to modify files at runtime
5. ❌ Deleted the authentik client file 
6. ❌ Replaced the problematic TopBar with a simplified version

## Why Docker Works But Kubernetes Doesn't

1. **Image Caching**: Kubernetes might be using a cached version of the image
2. **Development Server Behavior**: The way Astro+Vite work in dev mode is different than in production
3. **SSR Processing Order**: In Kubernetes, the SSR process might start before our modifications take effect
4. **Volume Mounting**: How files are mounted and accessed in Kubernetes vs Docker can differ

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Direct Shell Access**: Get a shell into the running pod to verify file contents
2. **Verbose Logging**: Enable verbose logging for Astro/Vite to see module resolution details
3. **Test with Regular Docker**: Compare file paths and environment inside plain Docker vs Kubernetes pod
4. **Alternative Approach**: Consider running in production mode with a proper SSR adapter

## Recommended Solution Path

1. **Create Empty Authentik Client**: Create dummy authentik client in the source that doesn't throw errors
2. **SSR Adapter**: Consider using an SSR adapter for Astro (like Node.js adapter)
3. **Production Mode**: Try running in production mode instead of development
4. **Build-time Modifications**: Make all changes during build, not at runtime
