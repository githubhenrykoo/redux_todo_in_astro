# Todo App with Redux in Astro

A modern Todo application built with Astro, React, and Redux, demonstrating a data-driven, functionally pure approach to state management. Built on the foundational principle of Single Source of Truth (SSoT), this project showcases how complex behaviors can be encoded in version-controlled data structures rather than hand-written code. By leveraging the Flux architectural pattern through Redux, the system ensures unidirectional data flow and predictable state mutations, creating a reliable foundation for self-improving workflows.

This project implements a data-driven, functionally pure framework for an AI-powered [Progressive Knowledge Container](./Personal%20Knowledge%20Container.md) (PKC), built on the foundational principle of Single Source of Truth (SSoT). By adopting the Flux architectural pattern, the system ensures that all state changes flow unidirectionally through version-controlled data structures, creating a reliable foundation for machine learning workflows. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using JavaScript and WASM, it minimizes hand-written code in favor of version-controlled data structures that define not only system behavior, but also the functionality and configurations of user interfaces. The framework serves as a thin orchestration layer that composes pure functions based on declarative configurations, connecting external data stores (LLMs, SQLite, IndexedDB) with a browser-based interface. At its core, the system creates a self-improving workflow that iteratively refines both its knowledge base and operational patterns through structured data management, with each iteration maintaining SSoT through Flux's predictable state mutations. By encoding complex behaviors, user interface configurations, and functionality in data rather than code, the system can learn and evolve its own workflows while maintaining functional simplicity and predictability, all while ensuring data consistency through version-controlled state management.

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

- **Single Source of Truth (SSoT)**: Redux serves as the central state management system, ensuring consistent and predictable data flow throughout the application
- **Functional Purity**: Embraces pure functions and immutable state updates to reduce side effects and enhance code reliability
- **Data-Driven Architecture**: Leverages structured data configurations to drive complex behaviors, reducing manual code maintenance
- **Flux Architecture**: Implements unidirectional data flow pattern for predictable state updates and improved debugging
- **Continuous Evolution**: Supports iterative improvements through modular design and data-centric architecture

## MCard Implementation

### Overview

A foundational content management system that integrates Redux with Astro's Content Layer, utilizing MCard for content-addressable storage. This system implements an algebraically closed data structure that enables individual knowledge owners to manage their personal namespace of hash-value-based data content.

### Core Features

#### Content Management
- Content-addressable storage using cryptographic hashes
- Microsecond-precision temporal ordering
- Cross-platform compatibility (JavaScript/Python)
- Full-text search capabilities
- Bidirectional synchronization

#### UI Components
- Retractable mini and wide sidebar
- Scrollable sidebar menu
- Sheet menu for mobile
- Grouped menu with labels
- Collapsible submenu

### Architecture

#### MCard Core
The system uses a unified `Card_Collection` class for both client-side and server-side content management:

```typescript
interface MCard {
  content: Buffer;          // The actual data being stored
  hash: string;            // Cryptographic hash of content
  g_time: string;         // Timezone-aware timestamp
  content_type: string;   // Content type identifier
}
```

#### Data Schema
Primary table structure in SQLite:
```sql
CREATE TABLE card (
  hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- Unique identifier
  content BLOB NOT NULL,    -- Binary or UTF-8 encoded data
  g_time TEXT NOT NULL     -- Global timestamp
);

-- Full-text search support
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE documents USING fts5(content);
```
