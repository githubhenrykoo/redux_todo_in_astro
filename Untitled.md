[Opening]
Hello, everyone! My name is Alessandro Rumampuk, and today Iâ€™m excited to share with you an overview of a new features I have created: Terminal Commands Running in ChatBot. This features integrates a local terminal with a chatbot, allowing users to execute commands seamlessly.

[Summary]
The chatbot I developed supports natural language terminal commands, making it more accessible to users, especially those who are not familiar with traditional command-line interfaces.

The key features of this system include:

A command prefix system using the "$" symbol for structured command execution.
Real-time command execution with streaming output directly in the chatbot interface.
A command translation system, which helps interpret user inputs and execute corresponding terminal commands.
File system access, enabling users to read, list, and manage files effortlessly.
A user guide feature, which helps users understand and execute terminal commands effectively.

[Command Processing]
One of the main functionalities of this chatbot is its ability to handle natural language file operations and system commands. For example, users can read a file by saying *"Read the testing.txt,"* which executes `cat` to display its contents. To list files in a directory, they can say *"List files in downloads,"* corresponding to the `ls Downloads/` command. Creating a new directory is as simple as saying *"Make directory testing,"* which runs `mkdir` to create a directory named *testing*. Similarly, users can delete a file by saying *"Delete file testing.txt,"* triggering `rm` to remove the file *testing.txt*. Lastly, asking *"Where am I?"* executes `pwd`, allowing users to check their current directory.

[User Interface Enhancements]
To improve usability, I implemented several UI enhancements:

Word selection for quick input, making it easier for users to choose commands.
Toggle functionality, allowing smooth switching between different modes.
Better control mechanisms, providing a more intuitive experience.
Improved input efficiency, reducing the time required for command execution.

[Recommendations]
To improve the terminal more interactive in the future, I will add Lazygit.
Natural Language Processing Enhancements
Security Enhancements
Adding confirmation dialogs before executing critical commands
Terminal User Interface Feature Enhancements

[Closing]
This chatbot bridges the gap between traditional terminal usage and natural language interaction, making command execution more intuitive and accessible. With future improvements in NLP, security, and UI, this system has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with terminal environments.

Thank you for listening!
