      "message": "Assistant (llama3): Addition with carry-over is a fundamental concept in arithmetic that helps us perform calculations when adding numbers together, especially when dealing with large or multi-digit numbers.\n\nWhen you're adding two numbers and the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value for a single digit (usually 9), you need to \"carry over\" the extra value to the next column. This is where carry-over comes in.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Start by adding the digits together, as you normally would:\n```\n  7 + 5 = 12\n```\n2. Since the result (12) exceeds the maximum value for a single digit (9), you need to \"carry over\" the extra value (3) to the next column.\n3. Write the carried-over value (3) above the line, and add it to the next column:\n```\n  7 + 5 = ?\n     3\n  _______\n    12\n```\n4. Now, add the remaining digits together:\n```\n  7 + 5 = ?\n     3\n  _______\n    1 2 (becomes 14)\n```\nThe final result is:\n```\n  7 + 5 = 14\n```\n\nCarry-over helps you to:\n\n* Correctly add large numbers by \"shifting\" the extra value to the next column.\n* Avoid errors by ensuring that you're not exceeding the maximum value for a single digit.\n\nThis concept applies to all types of addition, including multi-digit numbers, decimals, and even hexadecimal or binary values!\n\nDo you have any specific questions about carry-over or would you like more examples?",
