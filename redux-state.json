      "llmResponse": "Addition with carry-over is a fundamental concept in arithmetic that helps us perform calculations when adding numbers together, especially when dealing with large or multi-digit numbers.\n\nWhen you're adding two numbers and the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value for a single digit (usually 9), you need to \"carry over\" the extra value to the next column. This is where carry-over comes in.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Start by adding the digits together, as you normally would:\n```\n  7 + 5 = 12\n```\n2. Since the result (12) exceeds the maximum value for a single digit (9), you need to \"carry over\" the extra value (3) to the next column.\n3. Write the carried-over value (3) above the line, and add it to the next column:\n```\n  7 + 5 = ?\n     3\n  _______\n    12\n```\n4. Now, add the remaining digits together:\n```\n  7 + 5 = ?\n     3\n  _______\n    1 2 (becomes 14)\n```\nThe final result is:\n```\n  7 + 5 = 14\n```\n\nCarry-over helps you to:\n\n* Correctly add large numbers by \"shifting\" the extra value to the next column.\n* Avoid errors by ensuring that you're not exceeding the maximum value for a single digit.\n\nThis concept applies to all types of addition, including multi-digit numbers, decimals, and even hexadecimal or binary values!\n\nDo you have any specific questions about carry-over or would you like more examples?",

      "llmResponse": "Addition with carry-over is a fundamental concept in arithmetic, especially when dealing with multi-digit numbers. Let's dive into it!\n\n**What is Addition with Carry-over?**\n\nWhen adding two or more multi-digit numbers, you might encounter situations where the sum of the individual digits exceeds the value of the next place value (column). In such cases, you need to \"carry over\" the excess value to the next column, making adjustments as needed. This process helps ensure that the result is accurate.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we're adding 123 and 456. Let's perform the addition step by step:\n\n1. Add the ones place (3 + 6 = 9)\n2. Add the tens place (2 + 5 = 7, with a carry-over of 1 from the ones place)\n3. Add the hundreds place (1 + 4 + 1 [carried over] = 6)\n\nThe final answer is 579.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. When adding multi-digit numbers, keep track of any carry-overs as you perform each step.\n2. Always add the digits from left to right (hundreds place first).\n3. If a digit's value exceeds the next column's capacity (e.g., 9 + 6 = 15), \"carry over\" the excess value to the next column.\n\n**Practice Time!**\n\nTry adding these examples on your own:\n\n1. 234 and 567\n2. 945 and 278\n\nRemember to carry over any excess values as needed, and you'll be a pro at addition with carry-over in no time!\n\nDo you have any questions or would you like more practice problems?",
