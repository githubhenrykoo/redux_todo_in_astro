## A Sample Logic Model Form
A visual illustration of [[Logic Model]] is shown below, a reusable Markdown template for this form is available as [[LMTemplate]] and [[Logic Model Generating Prompt]] for [[Obsidian]].

## The Logic Model's Structure (A Computational Trinity)

A logic model typically consists of seven components, mirroring the **[[Computational Trinitarianism]]** of Logic, Languages, and Categories:

1. **[[Context in Logic Model|Context]] (Precondition):** Defines the spatial and temporal environment, setting the stage (Logic).
2. **[[Goal in Logic Model|Goals/Objectives]] (Command):** Broad statements of desired long-term achievements (Languages).
3. **[[Success Criteria]] (Postcondition):** Specific, measurable outcomes resulting from program outputs (Logic).
4. **[[Inputs]]/Resources (Precondition):** Assets (funding, personnel, etc.) dedicated to program implementation (Languages).
5. **[[Activities]] (Command):** Actions taken using resources to produce desired outputs (Languages).
6. **[[Outputs]] (Postcondition):** Direct, measurable products or services resulting from activities (Logic).
7. **[[Balanced Expectations]] (Boundary Conditions):** Statements defining realistic expectations and capturing ongoing experiences, formerly known as **[[Boundary Conditions]]** (Categories).

These fields can be expressed in natural or formal languages ([[Gherkin]], [[Zencode]]) akin to [[Behavior-driven development]] ([[BDD]]) and [[Ansible]].

## Grokking Causation in PKCs

Personal Knowledge Containers ([[PKC|PKCs]]) revolutionize note-taking by integrating data encryption, Large Language Models (LLMs), and the Logic Model. Like [[Activity-based Cost Accounting]] ([[ABC Accounting]]) transformed accounting, the Logic Model within PKCs captures causal relationships at the "speed of thought," mirroring complex system dynamics. See [[Grok]].

### Recording Causations at the Speed of Thought

This approach empowers users and the data infrastructure:

- **[[Causality]] at the Core:** The Logic Model documents events and their interconnectedness, enabling deep understanding of "why," not just "what."
- **Data Integrity:** Encryption secures PKC contents, while LLMs aid organization, turning data into reliable evidence.
- **Unified Framework:** The Logic Model provides a consistent structure, fostering a holistic view of knowledge.

Thus, PKCs evolve from static notes to dynamic knowledge ecosystems, facilitating the seamless capture of "why" alongside "what."

### Logic Model as Executable Atomic Notes

We implement Logic Models as [[Executable Atomic Note|Executable Atomic Notes]] or [[Atomic Essay|Atomic Essays]], based on the [[File]] data abstraction (Unix), enriched with metadata. Each change triggers an event recorded on a blockchain, ensuring integrity.

## Logic Models as a Grokking Tool

The Logic Model aids stakeholders in [[Grok|grokking]] a program's theory of change, identifying areas for improvement, and assessing effectiveness. By mapping logic and assumptions, it simplifies measuring progress and making evidence-based decisions.

### Front End to the Logical Kernel: Bridging Abstract and Concrete

The Logic Model serves as an interface to an executable logic kernel ([[bridgelet]]). To address the human tendency to lose focus, it provides a project-centric view, binding users to essential data. Two parallel boxes capture connections between the abstract (Context, Goal, Success Criteria) and the concrete (Inputs, Process, Outputs), forming [[Hoare triple|Hoare triples]] (vertical and horizontal compositions in [[Category Theory]]).

### Grokking with Generative AI and Deep Reasoning

**Generative AI** assists in filling gaps, suggesting outcomes, identifying missing steps, or generating alternative scenarios within the Logic Model. **Deep Reasoning** analyzes relationships, uncovering patterns, predicting roadblocks, and offering optimization insights.

### Realistic Expectations (Boundary Conditions)

Realistic Expectations, formerly Boundary Conditions, are statements defining pre- and post-conditions, crucial for consensus and viewed as [[Yoneda Embedding|Yoneda Embeddings]] in [[Category Theory]].

The **[[Logic Kernel]]**, implemented using PKCs, interprets and executes logic models. This approach, combined with the computational trinitarianism framework, enables a deeper, more intuitive understanding ([[Grok|grokking]]) of complex systems and causal relationships.
