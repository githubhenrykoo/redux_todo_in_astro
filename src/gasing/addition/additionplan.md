# Optimized Addition Algorithm Plan

## 1. Pre-processing Stage
- Separate input numbers into individual digits
- Create pre-computed lookup tables for single-digit addition results
- Use bytearrays instead of lists for better performance with numeric data

## 2. Lookup Tables
- Create a single 10Ã—10 table (DIGIT_SUMS) with the actual sum results (0-18) for all possible digit combinations
- This approach eliminates the need for separate sum and carry status tables
- Each table entry directly contains the complete sum, which may be > 9

## 3. Optimized Addition Algorithm
1. Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant)
2. Use the lookup table to get the actual sum at each position
3. For each position:
   - Look up the complete sum from the DIGIT_SUMS table
   - Add any carry from the previous position
   - Extract the result digit using modulo (total % 10)
   - Extract the carry using integer division (total // 10)

4. Implementation steps:
   - Process each digit once from right to left
   - Use table lookups to get basic sums
   - Add carry from previous positions
   - Extract new digits and carries directly

## 4. Performance Optimizations
- Minimize memory allocation by pre-allocating arrays
- Use direct array indexing instead of conditionals
- For small numbers (< 20 digits), use Python's built-in methods
- Move lookup table creation outside the function (module level constants)
- Use bytearray or NumPy arrays for better performance

## 5. Implementation Approach
- Create a hybrid system balancing correctness with performance
- Focus on minimizing branching operations
- In Python, table lookups provide better performance than complex conditionals
- Precompute as much as possible to minimize calculations during addition

## 6. Cross-Environment Considerations
- Ensure code works in both Node.js and browser environments
- Implement appropriate polyfills for TextEncoder and Buffer
- Use conditional imports for environment-specific optimizations
