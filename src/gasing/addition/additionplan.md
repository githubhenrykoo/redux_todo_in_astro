the calculation will stat with separting the numbers into digits

and we will have a table of single digit addition output so we can use it dircety

now instead of finding 9 we will find the number that is biger then 9 so in this case it wont affect and now if we find it we will see if the number is to the right is a 9 if yes it will plus one if no it will just plus one to the number


so we dont have to identify the lenght
