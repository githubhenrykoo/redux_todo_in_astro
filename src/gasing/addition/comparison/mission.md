[20/07/25, 11.16.38] Yohanes Surya: Pak Yohanes, I fixed the Python program. Now it prints out the clusters and the final results.

NB: I added capabilities to handle corner cases like I wrote in the PDF. If you try the program, the string “CC” in a cluster inficates a corner case
[20/07/25, 11.16.58] Yohanes Surya: Can you check and compare your python program and this?
[20/07/25, 15.21.50] Henry Koo: Ok no problem
[21/07/25, 03.16.39] Henry Koo: i will compare it and send you the comparison today
[21/07/25, 07.37.59] Yohanes Surya: Pak Yohanes, this is the Python program that implements an 8-bit Brent-Kung adder, exactly the same as what I wrote in the PDF I sent you.
[21/07/25, 07.38.17] Yohanes Surya: Please see this too
[21/07/25, 07.39.17] Yohanes Surya: Pak Yohanes, this is my analysis of your gasing algorithm. Unfortunately, based on my analysis, it is not as good as Brent-Kung. Note: ini masih metoda yg pake cluster search. Yg metoda lirik kanan belom saya bikin analisa nya.
